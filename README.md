## Ktor with Netty engine
### Netty vs Jetty
Netty: Easy to deal with network protocols; non-blocking, high-performance. Used by distributed data processing frameworks like Apache Spark, Presto, Cassandra, Akka; also by gRPC.
Jetty: a light HTTP servlet container. Similar to Tomcat; SpringBoot uses Tomcat by default but can be changed to use Jetty.
